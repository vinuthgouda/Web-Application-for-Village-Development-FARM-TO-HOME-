# Web-Application-for-Village-Development-FARM-TO-HOME-
The Farm to Home was built using flask in python. The structured data was stored using MySQL . The Consumer can log-in using his credentials to order crops. The Farmer after logging in can add crops to the database. The relational Schema has been reduced to 3rd Normal form, where multi valued attributes, composite attributes, partial and transitive dependencies have been removed.

Post the order the consumer has to wait for the confirmation of the order by the farmer followed by the further external transactions. The feedback form consists of the overall rating of the crop.
The same thing follows for the scene where the transaction happens between the farmer and consumer for the purchase of fertilizers. Thus, a complete working of the Farm to Home has been created and built to ensure an easy yet efficient experience for the customer to place his/her order. The project in overall focuses on reducing the burden of the farmer for selling the harvested crops, and also to overcome the involvement of the middlemen and curbing the farmerâ€™s profit.
